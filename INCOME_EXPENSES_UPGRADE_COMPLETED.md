## 🎯 ACHIEVED REQUIREMENTS

2. ✅ **Removed "Manage Categories" buttons** from both income and expense tabs
3. ✅ **Converted category dropdowns to text inputs** with auto-suggestions

5. ✅ **Added "Expense Name" field** to expense forms
6. ✅ **No regressions** - other modules remain unaffected
7. ✅ **Maintained clean, responsive UI** and all CRUD features
8. ✅ **Preserved visual tracking features** and functionality

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Category Suggestions Logic
The new category suggestion system works by:
1. Collecting all existing categories from income/expense entries
2. Collecting categories from inventory items
3. Collecting categories from the database categories collection
4. Ranking by frequency of use
5. Providing real-time filtering as user types

### Data Sources for Suggestions
- **Income Categories**: From `income` collection entries
- **Expense Categories**: From `expenses`, `salaryExpenses`, and `inventoryExpenses` collections
- **Inventory Categories**: From `inventory` collection items
- **Database Categories**: From `categories` collection

### User Experience
- Users can now type any category name
- As they type, relevant suggestions appear
- They can select from suggestions or create new categories
- New categories automatically become available for future use
- No more restrictive dropdowns or category management complexity
