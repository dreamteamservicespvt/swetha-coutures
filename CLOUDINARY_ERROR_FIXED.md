# 🔧 Cloudinary Configuration Error - FIXED

## ❌ The Problem

**Error Message:**
```
api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/your-cloud-name/image/upload:1
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 (Bad Request)
Error uploading screenshot: Error: Upload failed
```

**Root Cause**: 
- Environment variable `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` is **not set**
- Code was using placeholder `your-cloud-name` (invalid)
- Cloudinary rejected the request

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added configuration check before upload
- Clear error message if Cloudinary not configured
- Better error messages with details
- Console logging for debugging

### 2. Improved Validation
```typescript
// Before:
const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/${import.meta.env.VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME || 'your-cloud-name'}/image/upload`
);

// After:
const cloudName = import.meta.env.VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME;
if (!cloudName || cloudName === 'your-cloud-name') {
  toast({
    title: "Configuration Error",
    description: "Cloudinary is not configured. Please contact support.",
    variant: "destructive",
  });
  return;
}

const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/${cloudName}/image/upload`
);
```

### 3. Better Error Messages
```typescript
// Now shows specific error from Cloudinary
const errorData = await response.json().catch(() => null);
throw new Error(errorData?.error?.message || `Upload failed with status ${response.status}`);
```
