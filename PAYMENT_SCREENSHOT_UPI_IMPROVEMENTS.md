# Payment Screenshot Upload & UPI Code Improvements

## Summary
Fixed payment screenshot upload functionality and replaced the "Pay with UPI" button with a copyable UPI ID in the customer bill view.

## Changes Made

### 1. Payment Screenshot Upload Enhancement ✅

**Problem:**
- Previously, clicking "Upload Payment Screenshot" would immediately upload the selected image
- No preview or ability to change the selected image before upload
- No confirmation step

**Solution:**
- Added image preview dialog before upload
- Users can now:
  - Preview the selected image
  - Choose a different image if needed
  - Confirm before uploading
  - Cancel the upload

**Implementation Details:**

#### New State Variables:
```typescript
const [selectedImageFile, setSelectedImageFile] = useState<File | null>(null);
const [imagePreviewUrl, setImagePreviewUrl] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [showUploadDialog, setShowUploadDialog] = useState(false);
```

#### New Functions:
1. **`handleFileSelect`** - Handles file selection and shows preview dialog
   - Validates file type (images only)
   - Validates file size (max 5MB)
   - Creates preview URL using `URL.createObjectURL()`
   - Opens preview dialog

2. **`handleCancelUpload`** - Cancels upload and cleans up
   - Revokes preview URL to free memory
   - Resets all upload-related state
   - Closes dialog

3. **`handleConfirmUpload`** - Confirms and uploads to Cloudinary
   - Uploads to Cloudinary with proper settings
   - Updates Firebase with screenshot URL and timestamp
   - Shows success toast
   - Cleans up preview

#### UI Changes:
- Removed "Uploading..." state from button (moved to dialog)
- Added preview dialog with:
  - Image preview
  - Cancel button
  - "Choose Different Image" button
  - "Confirm & Upload" button
  - Loading state during upload

### 2. UPI Payment Button Replacement ✅

**Problem:**
- "Pay {amount} with UPI" button opened UPI apps
- Users had to manually copy UPI ID from elsewhere
- Not user-friendly for all UPI apps

**Solution:**
- Replaced button with copyable UPI ID display
- Added one-click copy functionality
- Better UX for manual UPI payments

**Implementation Details:**

#### New State Variable:
```typescript
const [copiedUPI, setCopiedUPI] = useState(false);
```

#### New Function:
**`handleCopyUPI`** - Copies UPI ID to clipboard
- Uses `navigator.clipboard.writeText()`
- Shows success toast
- Visual feedback (button changes to "Copied!")
- Auto-resets after 2 seconds

#### UI Changes:
**Before:**
```tsx
<Button onClick={handlePayWithUPI}>
  <Smartphone className="h-5 w-5 mr-2" />
  Pay {formatCurrency(bill.balance)} with UPI
</Button>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div className="bg-white rounded-lg border-2 border-green-300 p-4">
  <p className="text-xs text-gray-600 mb-2 font-medium">UPI ID</p>
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <div className="flex-1 bg-gray-50 rounded-md px-4 py-3 font-mono text-sm font-semibold">
      {bill.upiId}
    </div>
    <Button onClick={handleCopyUPI}>
      {copiedUPI ? <Check /> : <Copy />}
      {copiedUPI ? "Copied!" : "Copy"}
    </Button>
  </div>
</div>
```
