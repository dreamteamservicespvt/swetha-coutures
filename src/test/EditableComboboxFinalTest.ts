// Final Test Script for EditableCombobox Dropdown Selection Bug Fix

/**
 * ISSUE RESOLVED: Billing Page Dropdown Selection Bug
 * 
 * Problem: When selecting one item then another in Product Name or Sub-Item Description dropdowns,
 * the second selection would briefly appear then disappear, requiring multiple selection attempts.
 * 
 * Root Cause: Race condition between two timeout mechanisms managing the isSelecting state:
 * 1. 50ms timeout in handleSelect function  
 * 2. 150ms timeout in useEffect hook
 * 
 * Solution: Eliminated the dual timeout approach by:
 * - Removing setTimeout from handleSelect
 * - Using only useEffect-based timeout management (150ms)
 * - Adding separate timeout references to prevent conflicts
 * - Ensuring proper cleanup of all timeouts
 * 
 * Key Changes:
 * 1. Added justSelectedTimeoutRef for dedicated justSelected state management
 * 2. Removed setTimeout from handleSelect function
 * 3. Enhanced timeout cleanup in handleSelect and useEffect
 * 4. Consistent 150ms delay for all state transitions
 * 
 * Test Cases:
 * 1. Rapid selection: Select item A → immediately select item B → B should stick
 * 2. Multiple products: Test across different product rows independently
 * 3. Sub-item descriptions: Test in expanded product sub-items
 * 4. Mixed interactions: Combine typing and selecting
 * 
 * Expected Result: All selections work immediately without disappearing
