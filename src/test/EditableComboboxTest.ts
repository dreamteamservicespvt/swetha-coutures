// Test script to verify EditableCombobox fixes

/**
 * Test Cases for EditableCombobox fixes:
 * 
 * 1. Selection and Reselection Test:
 *    - Select an item from dropdown
 *    - Verify it stays selected
 *    - Select another item
 *    - Verify the second item is selected and doesn't revert
 * 
 * 2. Clear Value Test:
 *    - Select an item
 *    - Clear the input (make it empty)
 *    - Click outside or blur
 *    - Verify it stays empty (doesn't revert to previous value)
 * 
 * 3. Typing and Blur Test:
 *    - Start typing a partial match
 *    - Click outside without selecting
 *    - Verify behavior is correct based on allowAdd setting
 * 
 * 4. Rapid Selection Test:
 *    - Quickly select multiple items in succession
 *    - Verify the last selected item remains selected
 * 
 * Issues Fixed:
 * - handleInputChange no longer calls onValueChange for exact matches during typing
 * - handleInputBlur properly handles empty values for allowAdd=false fields
 * - handleClickOutside has better logic for exact matches and empty values
 * - handleSelect ensures proper state clearing and selection
