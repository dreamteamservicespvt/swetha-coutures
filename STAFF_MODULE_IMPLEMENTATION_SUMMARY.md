# Staff Module Implementation Summary

## 🔧 Staff Creation Bug Fixed

**Issue:** Staff.tsx:261 Error saving staff member: FirebaseError: Function addDoc() called with invalid data. Unsupported field value: undefined (found in field salary)

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `src/pages/Staff.tsx` to prevent undefined values in Firestore
- Changed salary field initialization from `undefined` to `0`
- Used conditional spread operator to only include optional fields when they have values
- Set default values for required fields: `salaryMode: 'monthly'`, `salary: 0`, `salaryAmount: 0`

## ✅ Role-Based Access Control Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Authentication & Authorization

**File:** `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`

- Added `adminOnly` and `staffOnly` props to restrict access

**File:** `src/components/DashboardRouter.tsx` (NEW)
- Smart dashboard router that shows appropriate dashboard based on user role
- Admin → AdminDashboard, Staff → StaffDashboard

### 2. Updated App Routes (`src/App.tsx`)

## 💰 Salary Calculation Algorithm

**Formula Implementation:**

ratePerTask = salaryMode === 'monthly' ? (salaryAmount / 30) : 
             salaryMode === 'daily' ? salaryAmount : 
             salaryAmount; // hourly

// Total earnings calculation
totalEarnings = (completedTasks * ratePerTask) + (workingDays * (baseRate / 30))
```

**Tracking Metrics:**
- Completed tasks from orders and custom tasks
- Working days from confirmed attendance records
- Real-time earnings updates
- Monthly earning projections

## 🚫 Security Measures

### Data Protection:
1. **Customer Privacy**: Phone numbers and email addresses completely hidden from staff views
2. **Financial Information**: No access to billing amounts, costs, or supplier pricing
3. **Role Enforcement**: Server-side validation prevents unauthorized access
4. **DOM Security**: Restricted data not included in DOM to prevent browser inspection access

### Permission Boundaries:
- Staff cannot access admin-only routes
- Staff cannot modify inventory costs or supplier info
- Staff cannot view customer contact information
- Staff cannot access billing or financial reports
