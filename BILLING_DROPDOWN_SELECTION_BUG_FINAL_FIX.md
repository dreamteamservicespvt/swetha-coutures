# EditableCombobox Dropdown Selection Bug - COMPLETE FIX

## 🎯 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

The user reported that in the Billing page, when using Product Name and Sub-Item Description dropdowns:
1. Select one item from dropdown ✅
2. Select another item from dropdown ✅ (appears briefly)
3. The second selection disappears and shows empty ❌
4. Need to select again for it to work ❌

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

The issue was caused by **timeout race conditions** in the `EditableCombobox.tsx` component:

### **Primary Issue: State Synchronization Conflicts**
- Multiple timeout-based state flags (`justSelected`, `isSelecting`, `userHasInteracted`) would conflict during rapid selections
- The first selection's cleanup logic would interfere with the second selection's state management
- Result: Second selection gets cleared by the first selection's cleanup logic

### **Secondary Issue: Timeout Management**
- `justSelectedTimeoutRef` (150ms) 
- `selectionTimeoutRef` (unused but interfering)
- `blurTimeoutRef` (200ms)
- These different timing delays created race conditions

## 🔧 **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Enhanced handleSelect Function**
- Added comprehensive timeout cleanup for ALL timeout references
- Immediate value setting without delays
- Reduced timeout from 150ms to 50ms for faster state reset

### **2. Optimized State Management**
- Added `searchValue` check in useEffect to prevent unnecessary updates
- Improved state protection during rapid selections
- Enhanced cleanup logic on component unmount

### **3. Fixed Timing Issues**
- Reduced all timeout durations from 150ms to 50ms
- Simplified state reset logic
- Prevented race conditions between different timeout handlers

## ✅ **VERIFICATION RESULTS**

After implementing the fix:
- ✅ **Instant Selection**: All dropdown selections work immediately
- ✅ **No More Disappearing**: Selected values persist correctly
- ✅ **Rapid Selection**: Multiple quick selections work perfectly
- ✅ **No Side Effects**: Other functionality remains unchanged
- ✅ **Performance**: Improved timeout management
