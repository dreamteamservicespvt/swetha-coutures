# ✅ CLOUDINARY CONFIGURATION FIXED

## 🎯 Issue Resolved

**Error:** "Upload preset not found" - 400 Bad Request

**Root Cause:** 
- Code was hardcoded to use upload preset `swetha_coutures`
- But your Cloudinary upload preset is named `swetha`

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated `.env` File
```env
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dvmrhs2ek
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=swetha
```

### 2. Updated PublicBillView.tsx
**Before:**
```typescript
formData.append('upload_preset', 'swetha_coutures');
```

**After:**
```typescript
const uploadPreset = import.meta.env.VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET || 'swetha';
formData.append('upload_preset', uploadPreset);
```

**Why:** Now reads upload preset from environment variables, making it flexible.

## 🚀 Next Step: RESTART SERVER

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST restart the dev server for changes to take effect!

### How to Restart:
1. Go to your terminal
2. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server
3. Run: `npm run dev`
4. Wait for server to start

**Why restart?**
- Environment variables (`.env` file) are only loaded when server starts
- Changes to `.env` require a restart to take effect

## ✅ Test Upload

After restarting server:

1. Open the customer shared bill link
2. Click "Upload Payment Screenshot"
3. Select an image
4. Preview should appear
5. Click "Confirm & Upload"
6. Should see success message! ✅

Expected console logs:
```
Uploading to Cloudinary: https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/dvmrhs2ek/image/upload
Using upload preset: swetha
```

## 📋 Your Cloudinary Configuration

## ❌ Troubleshooting

### Still getting "Upload preset not found"?

**Check Cloudinary Dashboard:**
1. Login to: https://cloudinary.com/console
2. Go to Settings → Upload tab
3. Find preset named: `swetha`
4. Verify:
   - ✅ Preset exists
   - ✅ Signing Mode is **"Unsigned"**
   - ✅ Preset is **enabled/active**

### Still getting 400 error?

**Check:**
1. ✅ Did you restart the dev server?
2. ✅ Is `.env` file saved?
3. ✅ Is cloud name correct: `dvmrhs2ek`
4. ✅ Is upload preset name correct: `swetha`

### Error: "Configuration Error"?

**This means:**
- `.env` file not loaded properly
- Restart server again
- Check `.env` is in project root (not in subdirectory)
